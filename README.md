# Meetapp

In Progress.
A Meetup.com clone. Will emphasize integration with Twitter, Facebook, (maybe G+), and scalability (Redis, Sidekiq or Resque, and cron jobs).

Current progress: working out layouts. Check the `foundation` branch.

#Architecture

See [erd]('/erd.pdf') for a visual representation of current models and associations.
